# BeCode watch : three.js introduction and Hello Cube

Introduction to three.js and Hello Cube - by Olivia Fantinel.
This exercice was done in the context of The Watch. The Watch is a daily activity at BeCode : someone must present a technology to their group for 10 to 20 minutes.

Clone the repo and don't forget to install three.js to make the code work. I installed it using ```npm install three``` in a node_modules folder.
You can install three.js however you want, just don't forget to change paths inside [script.module.js](https://github.com/tanoshiibot/watch-three.js/blob/main/script.module.js) and, if needed, [index.html](https://github.com/tanoshiibot/watch-three.js/blob/main/index.html).

## Why three.js ?

When I learned how to make 2D canvas animation, seeing I was really interested in those kind of things, my coach suggested me to learn about three.js. I wanted to understand WebGL more before learning three.js, but a group project kind of forced me to learn how to use three.js before I planned to. And I really like it.
I would like to share what I learned in less than a week about three.js with my group. I don't think it's very complicated, and there's so much more than what I showed, and that I know. I find this subject fascinating.

## Hello Cube !

The Hello Cube is the first thing I did following three.js documentation. A lot of my code was at first copy/paste of the documentation to try to make it display anything, so I needed to learn how everything **really** worked to explain it to others. 

## Hard to learn ?

At first, yes, I thought it was really hard to learn. I didn't understand why I couldn't load a picture as texture, I couldn't load a 3D model, etc. I was losing hope as I was getting more and more lost in the documentation. I wanted to buy Udemy lessons, but was sad that I couldn't just learn with the documentation as I did (I'm not saying Udemy lessons are bad, I would recommend you to take them if you like this way of learning). Joffrey Bienvenu, a Turing (IA department of BeCode) in my group for the project helped me understand three.js a little bit, and I beginned to understand more and more as I read the documentation. I don't think it's hard at all. Take your time to understand what you are doing, and don't go all-out on a big project the first week : learn slowly how to make cubes, and how to apply textures on them. Difficult stuff is for later.

### Thanks

* Thanks to [Joffrey Bienvenu]( http://joffreybvn.be/) for helping me with three.js ;
* Thanks to my friends who had to listen to my screams and tears of joy as I was able to load a cube with Cirno textures ;
* Thanks to my BeCode promo, Keller 2, for listening my Watch ;
* Thanks to you who read this way too long readme.md until the end, I'm happy you found my Watch interesting enough to read it !
